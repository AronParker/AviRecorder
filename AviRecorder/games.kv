// Phew. This file contains the supported source games and mods. Each entry consists of the following:
// 
// "Team Fortress 2"
// // refers to the name of the game
// {
//     "GameDir"		"<library>\\steamapps\\common\\Team Fortress 2\\tf"
//     // refers to the game directory which must contain the cfg folder and optionally a custom folder
//     
//     "Executable"	"<library>\\steamapps\\common\\Team Fortress 2\\hl2.exe"
//     // refers to the executable of the game that will be executed once recording starts
//     
//     "Arguments"		"-steam -game tf"
//     // refers to the command line arguments the game needs in order to run.
//     // This key is optional and will default to no arguments.
//     
//     "AppId"			"440"
//     // refers to the steam Application ID, which is used to acquire the launch options of the game.
//     // This key is optional for source games and should be left out for mods
// }
// 
// The keys "GameDir" and "Executable" support two path variables:
// 
// <steam> - refers to the steam installation directory (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam")  
// <library> - refers to any steam library folder
// 
// if "GameDir" contains a <library> variable, the first existing directory will be selected 
// if "Executable" contains a <library> variable, the first existing file will be selected
// If both "GameDir" and "Executable" contain a <library> variable, they must both exist within the same library
